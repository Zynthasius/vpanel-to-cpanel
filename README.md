# vPanel 2 cPanel
Wanna have a cPanel experience in vPanel(myownfreehost.net)? You have come to the right place.<br>
⚠️ **I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF IFASTNET SUSPENDS/TERMINATES YOUR RESELLER ACCOUNT!**

This project uses multiple Open Source Projects of WybeNetwork and a lot of Organizations, go visit <a href="https://github.com/wybenetwork">WybeNetwork</a> for more themes and for providing dark theme.

Steps >
1. Go fork my <a href="https://repl.it/@soundarrr/cpanel">repl.(Changing the scritps in Ifastnet panel takes a long time, so a small easy alternative).<br>
2. After forking edit script.js, find https://domain.org and replace it with your support system url(A KB or a Discord Server URL).
3. Copy the repl.it deployed URL(e.g https://cpanel.yourusername.repl.co).
3. Login into https://panel.myownfreehost.net and go to customise adverts area(Control Panel Adverts), choose the domain and add,
> Top Advert <br>


```<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cpanel.yourusername.repl.co/script.js"></script>```

> Bottom Advert <br>
```<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cpanel.yourusername.repl.co/icon_spritemap.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cpanel.yourusername.repl.co/styles.css">
```
And thats pretty much it, you just got vPanel looking like cPanel.
